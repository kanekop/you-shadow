Subject: Modify Warm-up Transcript Removal Logic in Custom Shadowing Evaluation

Hi AI Assistant,

Please modify the logic for removing the warm-up transcript in the `/evaluate_custom_shadowing` function within the `app.py` file.

**Current Situation:**
* The `WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT` variable is currently set to `"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0"` (or similar).
* The code uses `user_transcription.find(WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT)` to locate and remove the warm-up part.

**Problem:**
* This `find()` method only works if the user's transcription starts *exactly* with the full `WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT` (i.e., starts with "10, 9...").
* However, due to variations in recording start or speech recognition, the user's transcription might sometimes start *partway* through the sequence (e.g., `"7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, ..."`, or `"8, 7, 6..."`). In these cases, the current `find()` fails, and the warm-up is not removed.

**Required Change:**
* Modify the logic to handle these partial matches.
* Instead of looking for an exact match of the *entire* `WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT` at the beginning, check if the user's transcription `full_transcription.lower()` **starts with any suffix (ending part)** of the `WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT`.
* **Example Suffixes:** `"10, 9, ..., 0"`, `"9, 8, ..., 0"`, `"8, 7, ..., 0"`, ..., `"2, 1, 0"`, `"1, 0"`, `"0"`.
* **Logic:**
    1.  Iterate through all possible non-empty suffixes of the `WARMUP_TRANSCRIPT`.
    2.  For each suffix, check if `full_transcription.lower()` starts with that suffix (using `startswith()`).
    3.  If one or more suffixes match, identify the **longest** matching suffix.
    4.  If a match is found, remove that longest matching suffix from the beginning of `full_transcription.lower()` to get the final `user_transcription` for WER calculation.
    5.  If no suffix matches, assume there was no recognizable warm-up in the transcription and proceed with the full transcription (or handle as an edge case if appropriate).

**Goal:**
Ensure that even if the transcribed warm-up starts mid-sequence (e.g., "7, 6, 5..."), it is correctly identified and removed before calculating the WER score against the main content (`original_transcription`).

Please update the Python code in the `/evaluate_custom_shadowing` function in `app.py` to implement this suffix-matching logic for warm-up removal.
