You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician,
but ever since you criticized the emperor's tax laws,
you’ve been locked in the dungeon with only a marker to count the days.
But one day you're suddenly brought before the emperor,
who looks even angrier than usual.
One of his 12 governors has been convicted of paying his taxes
with a counterfeit coin,
which has already made its way into the Treasury.
As the kingdom's greatest mathematician,
you’ve been granted a chance to earn your freedom by identifying the fake.
Before you are the 12 identical looking coins and a balance scale.
You know that the false coin will be very slightly lighter or heavier than the rest.
But the emperor’s not a patient man.
You may only use the scale three times
before you’ll be thrown back into the dungeon.
You look around for anything else you can use,
but there's nothing in the room, just the coins,
the scale, and your trusty marker.
How do you identify the counterfeit?
